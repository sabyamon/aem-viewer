AEM Viewer
==========

AEM Viewer is an extension which helps developers and testers to quickly check information about a page which is hosted in Adobe AEM/Day CQ . 

Use cases for AEM Viewer .

The result has been split into three views , first tab shows the RAW data , second tab shows the Skimmed Data and the third tab shows the Quick Links that developers use to in their day to day life. 

**** Intention is to show data in a non geeky way in the "Skimmed Data" tab and dumping the raw data in the "RAW Data" tab.

#### For Developers :

1. Quickly Debug a AEM/CQ Page . (To debug in Author Environment, please remove the content finder 'cf#' from the url ) .
2. To know what are the components a CQ page is made of .
3. Check who has created , modified and activated the page without going to CRXDE .
4. Checking Page Properties in Publisher .
5. Quick Links saves navigation time and helps devs to not remember some AEM urls used extensively for development.
6. Quick Links help devs quickly navigate to the urls that Developers need to use almost everyday .


#### For Testers :

1. Content Validation for a particular component.
2. Testing a component.
3. Check the template and page component of a particular page .

** This extension is intended to use in Author and Publish environments and not through dispatcher. 

Soon , I will add an update link from which you can take update for this extension.

Feedbacks are always welcome to make this extension more useful.
